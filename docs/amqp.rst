Connection to Central EGA
=========================

All Local EGA instances are connected to Central EGA using `AMQP, the
advanced message queueing protocol <http://www.amqp.org/>`_, that
allows application components to send and receive messages. Messages
are queued, not lost, and resend on network failure or connection
problems. Naturally, this is configurable.


In practice, the `reference implementation
<https://github.com/EGA-archive/LocalEGA/tree/master/ingestion/mq>`_
uses the RabbitMQ message broker for each LocalEGA, henceforth called
*local broker*, which is the **only** component with the necessary
credentials to connect to the Central EGA message broker, henceforth
called *central broker*. The other LocalEGA components are connected
to their respective local broker.

For each LocalEGA instance, the central broker configures a ``vhost``,
and creates the credentials to connect to that ``vhost`` in the form
of a *username/password* pair. The local brokers then use a connection
string with the following syntax:

.. code-block:: console

   amqps://<user>:<password>@<cega-host>:<port>/<vhost>


.. image:: /static/amqp.png
   :target: ./_static/amqp.png
   :alt: RabbitMQ setup

The connection is a two-way connection using a combination of a
*federated queue* and a *shovel*.

The local broker registers a *federated queue* with the central broker
as *upstream*, named ``to_fega``, and listens to the incoming
messages. In order to minimize the number of connection sockets, all
Local EGAs only use *one* federated queue towards the central broker,
and all messages in the queue are distinguished with a ``type``.

Ingestion workers listen to the downstream queue of the local
broker. If there are no messages to work on, the local broker will ask
its upstream queue if it has messages. If so, messages are moved
downstream. If not, ingestion workers wait for messages to arrive.

.. note:: This allows a Local EGA instance to *also* ingest files from
   other sources than Central EGA. For example, a message, external to
   Central EGA, could be dropped in the local broker in order to
   ingest non-EGA files.


The central broker receives notifications from the local broker using
a *shovel*. The local broker has an exchange named ``cega`` configured
such that all messages published to it get forwarded to CentralEGA
(using the same routing key). This is how we propagate the different
status of the workflow to the central broker, using the following
routing keys:

* ``files.verified`` for properly ingested files, ready to request an Accession ID.
* ``files.completed`` for properly backed-up files, ready to be distributed
* ``files.error`` for user-related errors
* ``files.inbox`` for inbox file operations

The shovel is backed by a ``to_cega`` queue in case the central broker
is temporarily unavailable. This is similar to a (reverse) federated
queue.

Message interface (API) CEGA |connect| LEGA
============================================

It is necessary to agree on the format of the messages exchanged
between Central EGA and any Local EGAs. All messages are
JSON-formatted. The `JSON schemas to described the message formats
<https://github.com/EGA-archive/LocalEGA/tree/master/ingestion/schemas>`_
can be found in the repository.

When the brokers exchange messages, the message headers have the following properties:

- a content type: ``application/json``
- delivery mode: 2 (for persistence)
- and a **required** correlation id, i.e. a `36-characters string
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Format>`_
  (as generated by `uuid_generate
  <https://linux.die.net/man/3/uuid_generate>`_).


Central EGA |cegatolega| Local EGA
----------------------------------

Central EGA uses a unique upstream queue, to minimize the number of
connection sockets. In order to distinguish messages, Central EGA adds
a field named ``type`` to all outgoing messages. There are 5 types of
messages so far:

* ``type=ingest``: an ingestion trigger
* ``type=cancel``: an ingestion cancellation
* ``type=accession``: contains an accession id
* ``type=mapping``: contains a dataset to accession id mapping (they
  are known at the metadata release stage or when permissions are granted by a DAC
* ``type=release``: contains an dataset accession id for release
* ``type=deprecate``: contains an dataset accession id for deprecation
* ``type=heartbeat``: A mean to check if the Local EGA instance is "alive"

Refer to the complete JSON Schemas for `the ingestion trigger message
format
<https://github.com/EGA-archive/LocalEGA/tree/master/ingestion/schemas/ingestion-trigger.json>`_
and `the Accession ID message format
<https://github.com/EGA-archive/LocalEGA/tree/master/ingestion/schemas/ingestion-accession.json>`_.

For example, an ingestion trigger would have the following format:

.. code::

		{
                                 "type": "ingest",
                                 "user": "john",
                             "filepath": "/inbox/user/dir1/file.txt.c4gh",
                  "encrypted_checksums": [ { "type": "sha256",
                                             "value": "82E4e60e7beb3db2e06...f28c4c942703dabb6d6" }]
		}

and an accession id message from Central EGA would be:

.. code::

		{
                                 "type": "accession",
                                 "user": "john",
                             "filepath": "/inbox/user/dir1/file.txt.c4gh",
                         "accession_id": "EGAF00000123456",
                  "decrypted_checksums": [ { "type": "sha256",
		                             "value": "7853c53a03ccfc38683e...533e68ab37b5b790074" },
                                           { "type": "md5",
					     "value": "ee25789673d8711563d5fcb7234f9a68" }]
		}


Central EGA |legatocega| Local EGA
----------------------------------

Messages from Local EGA to Central EGA are used in the following cases:

* Requesting an Accession ID
* Notifying of the completion of an ingestion
* Inbox operations
* User-related Errors

The message must contain the ``user`` or ``filepath``, and you can
refer to the `accession request
<https://github.com/EGA-archive/LocalEGA/tree/master/ingestion/schemas/ingestion-accession-request.json>`_
and `completion message
<https://github.com/EGA-archive/LocalEGA/tree/master/ingestion/schemas/ingestion-completion.json>`_
JSON Schemas. Valid checksum algorithms are "md5" and "sha256", where
"sha256" is preferred. For example, a request for an Accession ID
could be:

.. code::

		{
                                 "user": "john",
                             "filepath": "/inbox/user/dir1/file.txt.c4gh",
                  "decrypted_checksums": [ { "type": "sha256",
		                             "value": "7853c53a03ccfc38683e...533e68ab37b5b790074" },
                                           { "type": "md5",
					     "value": "ee25789673d8711563d5fcb7234f9a68" }]
		}

.. note:: When requesting an Accession ID, the md5 decrypted_checksums field is, for the moment, mandatory.

When an error occurs on the Local EGA side, but the error is
user-related, such as an invalid encryption format, or a missing file
in the inbox (after deletion, for example), the error message must
contain a field named ``reason``, explaining why the error occured. For example:

.. code::

		{
                                 "user": "john",
                             "filepath": "/inbox/user/dir1/file.txt.c4gh",
                               "reason": "File not found in inbox"
		}

The messages sent by the inbox hooks capture operation of the files,
be it a (re)upload, a rename or a removal.  They must contain the
fields: ``user``, ``filepath``, ``operation``, where the value is
either ``upload``, ``rename`` or ``remove``.  In the case of a file
renaming, the ``oldpath`` must be added to the required fields. For
example, a file upload message could be:

.. code::

		{
                                 "user": "john",
                             "filepath": "/inbox/user/dir1/file.txt.c4gh",
                            "operation": "upload"
		}

Optional fields can be added, such as ``filesize``, or
``encrypted_checksums``.
