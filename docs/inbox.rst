.. _`inbox login system`:

Inbox login system
==================

Central EGA keeps a database of users, with IDs and passwords, ssh
public keys and crypt4gh-compatible public keys.

We have `developed a solution
<https://localega-inbox.readthedocs.io>`_ allowing user authentication
via either a password or an SSH key against CentralEGA database
itself. The procedure is as follows: the inbox is started without any
created user. When a user wants to log into the inbox (actually, only
``sftp`` connections are allowed, not even ``ssh``), the system looks
up the username in a local cache, and, if not found, queries the
CentralEGA REST endpoint. Upon return, we store the user credentials
in the local cache and create the user's home directory. The user now
gets logged in if the password or public key authentication
succeeds. Upon subsequent login attempts, only the local cache is
queried, until the user's credentials expire. The cache has a default
TTL of one hour, and is wiped clean upon reboot (as a cache should).

We installed a hook to detect when a file is (re)uploaded, renamed or
deleted. The hook runs a checksum on the uploaded file and notifies
CentralEGA via a :doc:`shovel mechanism on the local message broker
<amqp>`.


.. note:: After proper configuration, there is no user maintenance, it is
   automatic. The other advantage is to have a central location of the
   EGA users.

   Moreover, it is also possible to add non-EGA users if necessary, by
   reproducing the same mechanism but outside the temporary
   cache. Those users will persist upon reboot.
