Contributing guidelines
=======================

We thank you in advance |thumbup| |tada| for taking the time to
contribute, whether with *code* or with *ideas*, to the Local EGA
project.

.. note:: Todo

-------------------
Did you find a bug?
-------------------

* Ensure that the bug was not already reported by `searching under Issues`_.

* Do :bolditalic:`not` file it as a plain GitHub issue (we use the
  issue system for our internal tasks (see Zenhub)).  If you're unable
  to find an (open) issue addressing the problem, `open a new one`_.
  Be sure to prefix the issue title with **[BUG]** and to include:

  - a *clear* description,
  - as much relevant information as possible, and 
  - a *code sample* or an (executable) *test case* demonstrating the expected behaviour that is not occurring.
